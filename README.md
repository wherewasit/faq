# FAQ about the WhereWasIt Chrome Extension
The following are answers to some frequently asked questions about the WhereWasIt Chrome Extension. If you have a question that is not addressed here or any other feedback, please contact us at [feedback@wherewasit.xyz](mailto:feedback@wherewasit.xyz).

- **Q:** How do I view my remaining balance and expiration date?<br/>
  **A:** You can view your balance and expiration date by clicking on the profile picture in the upper left corner of the extension.

- **Q:** Why may I not purchase more credits before using up all of my current credits?<br/>
  **A:** Credits have expiration date. If we allow purchasing credits while there are valid credits remaining, we can end up with multiple expiration dates. The restriction aims to avoid this complication.

- **Q:** I do not have enough credits to perform operations, but the extension does not let me purchase more credits.<br/>
  **A:** As long as you have a positive balance of valid credits, you can perform an operation even if it will result in a negative balance. At that point, the option to purchase credits will appear.
